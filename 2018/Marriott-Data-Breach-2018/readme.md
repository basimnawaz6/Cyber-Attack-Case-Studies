## üìÑ Summary  
The **Marriott International data breach** was one of the most severe corporate cybersecurity failures in history, exposing **339 million guest records** from the Starwood Hotels reservation system. This **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** attack went undetected for **four years**, even through Marriott's 2016 acquisition of Starwood.  

Attackers exfiltrated highly sensitive data including **5.25 million unencrypted passport numbers** and **9.1 million weakly protected payment cards**, triggering landmark **GDPR enforcement** and costing the company over **$1 billion** in fines, settlements, and remediation.

- **Primary Attack Vector:** Remote Access Trojan (RAT) + credential harvesting  
- **Key Exploits:**  
  - Flat network architecture with no segmentation  
  - Absence of multi-factor authentication  
  - Misrepresentation of SHA-1 "encryption" on payment cards  
- **Affected Data:**  
  - 339 million guest records (PII, travel history)  
  - 5.25 million unencrypted passport numbers  
  - 9.1 million weakly protected payment cards  
- **Regulatory Impact:**  
  - **¬£18.4 million** GDPR fine (UK ICO)

## üîç Technical Overview  
1. **Initial Compromise (2014)**  
   - Attackers gained access via RAT or unpatched servers (likely Windows Server/RDP vulnerabilities).  
2. **Persistence & Expansion**  
   - Used tools like **Mimikatz** for credential harvesting and privilege escalation.  
   - Exploited flat network design to move laterally into Starwood‚Äôs reservation database.  
3. **Data Exfiltration (2014‚Äì2018)**  
   - Systematically copied and encrypted guest records to avoid detection.  
4. **Discovery (2018)**  
   - IBM Guardium anomaly detection flagged a suspicious SQL query that revealed the breach.

## üõ° Recommendations  
- **M&A Cybersecurity:** Require comprehensive cybersecurity due diligence during acquisitions.  
- **Zero Trust Implementation:** Enforce network micro-segmentation and least-privilege access.  
- **Data Governance:**  
  - Classify and encrypt sensitive data using strong encryption (AES-256).  
  - Implement strict data retention and deletion policies.  
- **Threat Detection & Response:**  
  - 24/7 SOC monitoring with **EDR** and **UEBA** solutions.  
  - Conduct quarterly **red team exercises** to test resilience.
